# College Exploration Shiny App ---------------------------------------------

# Load in datasets --------------------------------------------------------

      "This shiny app was built by EJ Arce, Simon Couch, and Alexander Moore 
      for Reed College's Statistics Practicum course in Spring 2019. The goal of
      our project is to provide prospective students as well as insitutional
      researchers a tool for comparing and learning about colleges using an
      approach that is both data-centered and deemphasizes hierarchy. There are
      two main deliverables this application provides. The first one is a 
      scatterplot tool that allows the user to visualize 2-4 specific 
      institutional features they may be interested in. The second one 
      implements a model we built that attempts to 
      most objectively quantify the degree of similarity between any
      two schools. The model allows the user to weigh the institutional
      characteristics they deem most important to them, presenting a
      list of options catered to their preferences when evaluating colleges
      The third tab on the shiny app describes the source of the data used for
      this project and explicitly describes what each variable means. Data on
      institutional features about the school are obtained from the Integrated
      Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) 2016 surveys while data on 
      social mobility are obtained from Opportunity Insights' Mobility 
      Report Card. A full report detailing our methods is available at
      https://github.com/Reed-Statistics/College-Exploration"}
